- 👋 Hi, I’m @vivekchandra007
- 👀 I’m interested in everthing about coding :) 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Quantum Computing and Web3.0 's decentralized file databases.

- 🏢 As an accomplished Front-End Architect specializing in the development of cutting-edge 🔪 web applications, I bring over 13 years of invaluable experience 💎 to the table. Throughout my career, I have demonstrated a passion for creating intuitive UI, optimizing performance, and implementing scalable solutions, while collaborating effectively with cross-functional teams.

- Over the course of my career, I have honed my skills in a wide range of front-end technologies, frameworks, and tools 🧰.    
My core competencies include:
  - **Front-End Development**: Proficient in HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript (ES6+), Typescript (TS) and responsive design principles, I have a keen eye for detail and a commitment to delivering visually appealing and highly functional UI.
  - **JavaScript Frameworks**: I have extensive experience working with popular JavaScript frameworks such as React.js and Vue.js. I excel in leveraging these frameworks to build robust, interactive, and scalable web applications.
  - **UI/UX Design**: I possess a deep understanding of user-centered design principles and have a track record of designing intuitive and engaging user interfaces. Proficient in tools such as InVision, Figma, etc.
  - **Performance Optimization**: I am adept at optimizing web applications for speed and performance, through browser insights and tools like Lighthouse, etc. I have hands-on experience with techniques such as code minification, lazy loading, image optimization, and caching to ensure optimal user experience and loading times. 
  - **Testing and Automation**: I have a strong background in test-driven development (TDD) and have used testing frameworks like Jest and Jasmine to write comprehensive unit tests. I also have experience with CI/CD pipelines.

- Right now, I am spearheading 🏹 frontend development of an MLOps 🤖 product offering by Deutsche Telekom, called "HALO".
One of my most notable experience has been developing Siemens’ internal web UI declarative framework: “Siemens Web Framework”.

- On my personal front (!end), mostly self motivated, I frequently contribute towards digital social initiatives of non-profit organisations in my neighbourhood.

- When not thinking about technical solutions, I love to frame-freeze Nature ⛰️, specially landscapes and night (starry) sky 🌃. While the images get processed for timelapse video, I catch up on classic Sci-Fi movie(s) 🎥 by Kubrick or Spielberg or Nolan, while speculating about their spiritual 🙏 analogies.

- Ready to take on new challenges, I am a valuable asset 💎 in driving innovation and delivering exceptional product experiences.
